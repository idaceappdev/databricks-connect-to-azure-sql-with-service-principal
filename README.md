# Integrate Databricks to Azure SQL with MSAL using secret and certificates

MSAL provides different APIs depending on the client type being used. You may refer to the following [GitHub page](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/wiki/Microsoft-Authentication-Client-Libraries/) for a detailed list of various APIs offered. We will use MSAL to authenticate with AAD and integrate our Databricks with SQL.
